## Real-Time Anomaly Detection in IOT Sensor Data  
##### In this notebook we will be showcasing real-time data ingestion leveraging SingleStore's Pipeline function.   
##### We will utilize Python in SingleStore's Notebook  to generate vector embeddings, leveraging  SQL support for vector processing (dot_product function) to flag anomalies.
